### There are 4 reasons why I started this website.

#### 1
The first is to keep track of my work for myself. Its like a yearbook where you get to look back on what you did, but instead of cringy group photos, its cringy mistakes on engineering projects!

#### 2
The second reason is to showcase my work to others. Its convenient to have one link I can give professors and companies to show my work. 

#### 3
The third reason is to tell people my mistakes so that others dont make them. I have made many explosive and expensive mistakes, so I hope I can save others from mking the same ones.

#### 4
The fourth reason is to write about interesting ideas. I was inspired by blogs such as Paul Grahm, kogappa.com, alexw.substack.com, and blog.samaltman.com
because they had such interesting ideas about, life, startups, and engineering. I hope to contribute to the conversation with my own ideas. 


#### Therefore, my website will have a combination of projects and essays.
