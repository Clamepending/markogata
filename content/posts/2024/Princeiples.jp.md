I read some books and came across nuggets of wisdom that I will most likely carry for the rest of my life.
Here are some of them in no particular order:


- aging is a desease - David A. Sinclair
- Polish the mind and polish the body
- exponential growth is unpredictably fast
- invest long term
- read books
- meet people in person (don't zoom)
- Be arrogant enough to take on the challenge, and humble enough to learn from others
- Move towards your goals a tiny bit every day
- Say hi to the person next to you
- its almost always better to do nothing than to consume social media or play games without friends.
