Many of my friends say my course load is crazy. I think I am taking an ambitious course load as well, but I found some optimizations (life hacks) that let me do more in a day.
Here are some:

## Get an electric skateboard

It is as fast as a car in short to medium distances, costs 30 times less, doesn't need gasoline, doesnt require a license, and doesn't require any parking.
You might think bikes or scooters may be good alternatives, but they require parking, unlike a board which you just pick up when you get off and head into lecture. If I didn't have a board, I would probably go to less than half the lectures I go to now.

I save an average of around 8 minutes per commute between classes/dorm. Since I have around 4 classes a day, that is at least 40 minutes saved per day. In reality it is more like 1 hour per day because I eat out with friends and run errands as well. 

If you are STILL not convinced, do a calculation of the money equivalent of your time you are saving. If you estimate a $30/hour wage and save around 1 hour a day, the board will pay for itself and more in less than a month (20days x $30 = $600).

I have a Boosted miniX. It lasts 2 days on 1 charge on regular use and is compact enough to carry around. (I don't recommend a longboard because they are bulkier than they need to be)

## Never eat alone

I still need to work on this one.

Balancing social life, academics and sleep is hard. Socialising while eating is a good way to regularly keep up with friends while also saving time. In middle school and highschool I usually used the lunch period to catch up with my friends. In college, I can use lunch and dinner (breakfast is too early) to socialise. It also saves money because campus dining halls are free, so instead of eating out often to socialise, I can catch up with friends more often  for free.

I still eat alone more than half of the time because I haven't set up regular eating times with friends yet. When I'm eating alone, I usually open a youtube video on a topic I need to learn for homework and listen to it while eating. After a meal I usually learned something new or unstuck myself in a homework problem I had been working on.

Since eating usually takes up around 1 hour per day, that is another hour saved.


## Sleep early

This one might not be obvious.
What do I usually do late at night? I usually scroll on youtube. 
If I sleep early and sleep in the time I would have used to go on social media, I get that much more time in the morning. I am much more likely to study in the morning when I am refreshed, so by sleeping early I saved time from being wasted. 

I started to think the next day starts when I fall asleep, not when I wake up. This is a subtle difference in mindset but it makes me want to sleep earlier. The reasoning is that sleeping later leads either to getting up late (the next day is partly ruined) or becoming sleep deprived (the  next day is fully ruined). So I set up success tomorrow by sleeping early today.

If you are determined to sleep late, at least sleep and get up at the same time everyday. This allows your body to develop a rhythm and go to sleep faster.


## Yeet your phone out the window (or out of sight)

I found putting my phone away was the difference between getting 5 minutes of studying done and getting 4 hours of studying done in a session. If you haven't tried it, I highly suggest you put your phone in another room or at least out of sight.
